/** \brief
 * Builds a sequence from a set of LineStrings so that
 * they are ordered end to end.
 *
 * A sequence is a complete non-repeating list of the linear
 * components of the input.  Each linestring is oriented
 * so that identical endpoints are adjacent in the list.
 *
 * A typical use case is to convert a set of
 * unoriented geometric links
 * from a linear network
 * (e.g. such as block faces on a bus route)
 * into a continuous oriented path through the network.
 *
 * The input linestrings may form one or more connected sets.
 * The input linestrings should be correctly noded, or the results may
 * not be what is expected.
 * The computed output is a single MultiLineString containing the ordered
 * linestrings in the sequence.
 * 
 * The sequencing employs the classic <b>Eulerian path</b> graph algorithm.
 * Since Eulerian paths are not uniquely determined,
 * further rules are used to
 * make the computed sequence preserve as much as possible of the input
 * ordering.
 * Within a connected subset of lines, the ordering rules are:
 *
 * - If there is degree-1 node which is the start
 *   node of an linestring, use that node as the start of the sequence
 * - If there is a degree-1 node which is the end
 *   node of an linestring, use that node as the end of the sequence
 * - If the sequence has no degree-1 nodes, use any node as the start
 *
 * Note that not all arrangements of lines can be sequenced.
 * For a connected set of edges in a graph,
 * <i>Euler's Theorem</i> states that there is a sequence
 * containing each edge once
 * <b>if and only if</b> there are no more than 2 nodes of odd degree.
 * If it is not possible to find a sequence, the isSequenceable method
 * will return <code>false</code>.
 *
