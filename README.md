# Spatialite extension fork
This is a fork of the https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage project. Some changes were made to allow the plugin to work with the *SpatiaLite* extension for SQLite.

SpatiaLite enables the SQLite database to understand and process spatial data, e.g. coordinates and shapes. For more information see https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index

Currently, only Android and iOS are supported to work with this plugin.

# Installation
Use the cordova command line tool in your project folder:
```
cordova plugin add https://github.com/DisyInformationssysteme/Cordova-spatialite-storage
```
