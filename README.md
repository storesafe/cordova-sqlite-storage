# Cordova/PhoneGap sqlite storage adapter (common-src branch)

Native interface to sqlite in a Cordova/PhoneGap plugin for Android, _and_ iOS, ~~and Windows "Universal" (8.1),~~ with API similar to HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/).

License for Android ~~and Windows "Universal" (8.1)~~ version~~s~~: MIT or Apache 2.0

License for iOS version: MIT only

This version branch contains the source code for the Android, iOS~~, and Windows "Universal" (8.1)~~ versions. This version branch does not contain any libraries or source code from www.sqlite.org. This version branch uses the built-in sqlite libraries on Android and iOS.

NOTE (TBD): no Circle CI or Travis CI working in this version branch.

## IMPORTANT: iCloud backup of SQLite database is NOT allowed

As documented in the "**A User’s iCloud Storage Is Limited**" section of [iCloudFundamentals in Mac Developer Library iCloud Design Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Conceptual/iCloudDesignGuide/Chapters/iCloudFundametals.html) (near the beginning):

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>DO</b> store the following in iCloud:
  <ul>
   <li>[<i>other items omitted</i>]</li>
   <li>Change log files for a SQLite database (a SQLite database’s store file must never be stored in iCloud)</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><b>DO NOT</b> store the following in iCloud:
  <ul>
   <li>[<i>items omitted</i>]</li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
- <cite><a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/General/Conceptual/iCloudDesignGuide/Chapters/iCloudFundametals.html">iCloudFundamentals in Mac Developer Library iCloud Design Guide</a>
</blockquote>

### More information about iCloud backup

There are two ways iCloud backup is configured:
- For each app, iCloud backup is configured in `config.xml` **and is enabled by default** (which I think is wrong) as documented at: https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/5.1.1/guide/platforms/ios/config.html
- In this plugin, the database is stored in the `Documents` subdirectory by default, which is backed up to iCloud. You can use the `location` option in `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()` to store the database in a subdirectory that is *NOT* backed up to iCloud.

Unless you want your app to use iCloud backup for some reason, it is recommended to turn it off as documented in: https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/5.1.1/guide/platforms/ios/config.html

I raised [Cordova bug CB-9830](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-9830) to disable iCloud backup by default in `config.xml`.

## Status

- Android version in this version branch is now using the built-in SQLite database classes.
- Windows "Universal" version is removed from this version branch.
- WP(7/8) is not supported by this version branch (TBD link to where WP(7/8) will be supported)
- The following features are moved to [litehelpers / cordova-sqlite-ext](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-ext) and removed from this project:
  - REGEXP support
  - Pre-populated database
- Amazon Fire-OS is dropped due to lack of support by Cordova. Android version should be used to deploy to Fire-OS 5.0(+) devices ref: [cordova/cordova-discuss#32 (comment)](https://github.com/cordova/cordova-discuss/issues/32#issuecomment-167021676)
- ~~Windows "Universal" for Windows 8.0/8.1(+) and Windows Phone 8.1(+) version is in an alpha state:~~
  - ~~Issue with UNICODE `\u0000` character (same as `\0`)~~
  - ~~No background processing (for future consideration)~~
  - ~~You *may* encounter issues with Cordova CLI due to [CB-8866](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-8866). *Old workaround:* you can install using [litehelpers / cordova-windows-nufix](https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-windows-nufix) and `plugman` as described below.~~

## Some apps using this plugin

- [Traiforks Mountain Bike Trail Map App](http://www.trailforks.com/apps/map/) with a couple of nice videos at: <http://www.pinkbike.com/news/trailforks-app-released.html>
- [Get It Done app](http://getitdoneapp.com/) by [marcucio.com](http://marcucio.com/)
- [KAAHE Health Encyclopedia](http://www.kaahe.org/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=817): Official health app of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

- [Tangorin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tangorin.app) (Android) Japanese Dictionary at [tangorin.com](http://tangorin.com/)

## Known issues

- iOS version does not support certain rapidly repeated open-and-close or open-and-delete test scenarios due to how the implementation handles background processing
- As described below, auto-vacuum is NOT enabled by default.
- INSERT statement that affects multiple rows (due to SELECT cause or using TRIGGER(s), for example) does not report proper rowsAffected on Android ~~in case [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector) is disabled (using the `androidDatabaseImplementation` option in `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase`)~~
- Memory issue observed when adding a large number of records due to the JSON implementation which is improved in [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free) (available with a different licensing scheme)
- A stability issue was reported on the iOS version when in use together with [SockJS](http://sockjs.org/) client such as [pusher-js](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-js) at the same time (see [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#196](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/196)). The workaround is to call sqlite functions and [SockJS](http://sockjs.org/) client functions in separate ticks (using setTimeout with 0 timeout).
- If a sql statement fails for which there is no error handler or the error handler does not return `false` to signal transaction recovery, the plugin fires the remaining sql callbacks before aborting the transaction.
- In case of an error, the error `code` member is bogus on Android ~~and Windows~~ (fixed for Android in [litehelpers / Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-enterprise-free)).
- Possible crash on Android when using Unicode emoji characters due to [Android bug 81341](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=81341), which _should_ be fixed in Android 6.x
- In-memory database `db=window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: ":memory:"})` is currently not supported.
- Close database bugs described below.
- When a database is opened and deleted without closing, the iOS version is known to leak resources.
- It is NOT possible to open multiple databases with the same name but in different locations (iOS version).
- Problems reported with PhoneGap Build in the past:
  - PhoneGap Build Hydration.
  - For some reason, PhoneGap Build may fail to build the iOS version unless the name of the app starts with an uppercase and contains no spaces (see [#243](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/243); [Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin#830](https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin/issues/830); [phonegap/build#431](https://github.com/phonegap/build/issues/431)).

## Other limitations

- The db version, display name, and size parameter values are not supported and will be ignored.
- This plugin will not work before the callback for the 'deviceready' event has been fired, as described in **Usage**. (This is consistent with the other Cordova plugins.)
- This version will not work within a web worker since are not supported by the Cordova framework.
- In-memory database `db=window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: ":memory:"})` is currently not supported.
- The Android version cannot work with more than 100 open db files (due to the threading model used).
- UNICODE line separator (`\u2028`) and paragraph separator (`\u2029`) are currently not supported and known to be broken in iOS version due to [Cordova bug CB-9435](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-9435).
- Blob type is currently not supported and known to be broken on multiple platforms.
- ~~Not a problem in this version branch: UNICODE `\u0000` (same as `\0`) character not working in Android (default native database implementation), Windows "Universal" (8.1/XX), or WP(7/8)~~
- Case-insensitive matching and other string manipulations on Unicode characters, which is provided by optional ICU integration in the sqlite source and working with recent versions of Android, is not supported for any target platforms.
- iOS version uses a thread pool but with only one thread working at a time due to "synchronized" database access
- Large query result can be slow, also due to JSON implementation
- ATTACH another database file is not supported (due to path specifications, which work differently depending on the target platform)
- User-defined savepoints are not supported and not expected to be compatible with the transaction locking mechanism used by this plugin. In addition, the use of BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK statements is not supported.
- Problems have been reported when using this plugin with Crosswalk (for Android). A couple of things you can try:
  - Install Crosswalk as a plugin instead of using Crosswalk to create the project.
  - Use `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` in the openDatabase options as described below.
- Does not work with [axemclion / react-native-cordova-plugin](https://github.com/axemclion/react-native-cordova-plugin) since the `window.sqlitePlugin` object exported (ES5 feature). It is recommended to use [andpor / react-native-sqlite-storage](https://github.com/andpor/react-native-sqlite-storage) for SQLite database access with React Native Android/iOS instead.
- ~~_In another version branch:_ FTS3/FTS4 and R-Tree are NOT supported for WP(7/8)~~

## Further testing needed

- Multi-page apps
- Use within [InAppBrowser](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/cordova_inappbrowser_inappbrowser.md.html)
- Use within an iframe (see [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#368 (comment)](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/368#issuecomment-154046367))
- SAVEPOINT(s)
- R-Tree is not tested for all older releases of Android in case [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector) is disabled (using the `androidDatabaseImplementation` option in `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase`)
- UNICODE characters not fully tested
- Use with TRIGGER(s), JOIN and ORDER BY RANDOM
- Integration with JXCore for Cordova (must be built without sqlite(3) built-in)
- Delete an open database inside a statement or transaction callback.

## Some tips and tricks

- If you run into problems and your code follows the asynchronous HTML5/[Web SQL](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) transaction API, you can try opening your database using `window.openDatabase` and see if you get the same problems.
- In case your database schema may change, it is recommended to keep a table with one row and one column to keep track of your own shema version number. It is possible to add it later. The recommended schema update procedure is described below.

## Common pitfall(s)

- It is NOT allowed to execute sql statements on a transaction following the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/), as described below.
- ~~Not in this version branch: It is possible to make a Windows Phone 8.1 project using either the `windows` platform or the `wp8` platform. The `windows` platform is highly recommended over `wp8` whenever possible. Also, some plugins only support `windows` and some plugins support only `wp8`.~~
- The plugin class name starts with "SQL" in capital letters, but in Javascript the `sqlitePlugin` object name starts with "sql" in small letters.
- Attempting to open a database before receiving the 'deviceready' event callback.
- Inserting STRING into ID field
- Auto-vacuum is NOT enabled by default. It is recommended to periodically VACUUM the database.

## Weird pitfall(s)

- intent whitelist: blocked intent such as external URL intent *may* cause this and perhaps certain Cordova plugin(s) to misbehave (see [litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage#396](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/396))

## Angular/ngCordova/Ionic-related pitfalls

- Angular/ngCordova/Ionic controller/factory/service callbacks may be triggered before the 'deviceready' event is fired
- As discussed in [#355](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/355), it may be necessary to install ionic-plugin-keyboard

## Major TODOs

- Integrate with IndexedDBShim and some other libraries such as Sequelize, Squel.js, WebSqlSync, Persistence.js, Knex, etc.

# Usage

## Echo test

To verify that both the Javascript and native part of this plugin are installed in your application:

```js
window.sqlitePlugin.echoTest(successCallback, errorCallback);
```

**IMPORTANT:** Please wait for the 'deviceready' event, (see below for an example).

## General

The idea is to emulate the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) as closely as possible. The only major change is to use `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()` (or `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`) instead of `window.openDatabase()`. If you see any other major change please report it, it is probably a bug.

**NOTE:** If a sqlite statement in a transaction fails with an error, the error handler *must* return `false` in order to recover the transaction. This is correct according to the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) standard. This is different from the WebKit implementation of Web SQL in Android and iOS which recovers the transaction if a sql error hander returns a non-`true` value.

## Opening a database

There are two options to open a database access object:
- **Recommended:** `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", location: 1}, successcb, errorcb);`
- **Classical:** `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase("myDatabase.db", "1.0", "Demo", -1);`

The `location` option is used to select the database subdirectory location (iOS *only*) with the following choices:
- `0` (default): `Documents` - visible to iTunes and backed up by iCloud
- `1`: `Library` - backed up by iCloud, *NOT* visible to iTunes
- `2`: `Library/LocalDatabase` - *NOT* visible to iTunes and *NOT* backed up by iCloud

**IMPORTANT:** Please wait for the 'deviceready' event, as in the following example:

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});
  // ...
}
```

The successcb and errorcb callback parameters are optional but can be extremely helpful in case anything goes wrong. For example:

```js
window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"}, function(db) {
  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    // ...
  }, function(err) {
    console.log('Open database ERROR: ' + JSON.stringify(err));
  });
});
```

If any sql statements or transactions are attempted on a database object before the openDatabase result is known, they will be queued and will be aborted in case the database cannot be opened.

**OTHER NOTES:**
- The database file name should include the extension, if desired.
- It is possible to open multiple database access objects for the same database.
- The database access object can be closed as described below.

### Android sqlite implementation

REMOVED from this version branch

~~By default, this plugin uses [Android-sqlite-connector](https://github.com/liteglue/Android-sqlite-connector), which is lightweight  and should be more efficient than the built-in Android database classes. To use the built-in Android database classes instead:~~

IGNORED in this version branch:

```js
var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", androidDatabaseImplementation: 2});
```

### Workaround for Android db locking issue

[Issue #193](https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage/issues/193) was reported (as observed by several app developers) that on some newer versions of the Android database classes, if the app is stopped or aborted without closing the database then:
- (sometimes) there is an unexpected database lock
- the data that was inserted is lost.

This issue is suspected to be caused by [this Android sqlite commit](https://github.com/android/platform_external_sqlite/commit/d4f30d0d1544f8967ee5763c4a1680cb0553039f), which references and includes the sqlite commit at: http://www.sqlite.org/src/info/6c4c2b7dba

There is an optional workaround that simply closes and reopens the database file at the end of every transaction that is committed. The workaround is enabled by opening the database with options as follows:

```js
var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db", androidDatabaseImplementation: 2, androidLockWorkaround: 1});
```

This option is ignored if `androidDatabaseImplementation: 2` is not specified.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This workaround is *only* applied when using `db.transaction()`, *not* applied when running `executeSql()` on the database object.

## SQL transactions

The following types of SQL transactions are supported by this version:
- Single-statement transactions
- Standard asynchronous transactions

### Single-statement transactions

Sample:

```Javascript
db.executeSql("SELECT LENGTH('tenletters') AS stringlength", [], function (res) {
  console.log('got stringlength: ' + res.rows.item(0).stringlength);
}, function(error) {
  console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);
});
```

## Standard asynchronous transactions

Standard asynchronous transactions follow the HTML5/[Web SQL API](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) which is very well documented and uses BEGIN and COMMIT or ROLLBACK to keep the transactions failure-safe. Here is a very simple example from the test suite:

```Javascript
db.transaction(function(tx) {
  tx.executeSql("SELECT UPPER('Some US-ASCII text') AS uppertext", [], function(tx, res) {
    console.log("res.rows.item(0).uppertext: " + res.rows.item(0).uppertext);
  }, function(error) {
    console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);
  });
}, function(error) {
  console.log('transaction error: ' + error.message);
}, function() {
  console.log('transaction ok');
});
```

In case of a read-only transaction, it is possible to use `readTransaction` which will not use BEGIN, COMMIT, or ROLLBACK:

```Javascript
db.readTransaction(function(tx) {
  tx.executeSql("SELECT UPPER('Some US-ASCII text') AS uppertext", [], function(tx, res) {
    console.log("res.rows.item(0).uppertext: " + res.rows.item(0).uppertext);
  }, function(error) {
    console.log('SELECT error: ' + error.message);
  });
}, function(error) {
  console.log('transaction error: ' + error.message);
}, function() {
  console.log('transaction ok');
});
```

**WARNING:** It is NOT allowed to execute sql statements on a transaction after it has finished. Here is an example from my [Populating Cordova SQLite storage with the JQuery API post](http://www.brodybits.com/cordova/sqlite/api/jquery/2015/10/26/populating-cordova-sqlite-storage-with-the-jquery-api.html):

```Javascript
  // BROKEN SAMPLE:
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "test.db"});
  db.executeSql("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tt");
  db.executeSql("CREATE TABLE tt (data)");

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    $.ajax({
      url: 'https://api.github.com/users/litehelpers/repos',
      dataType: 'json',
      success: function(res) {
        console.log('Got AJAX response: ' + JSON.stringify(res));
        $.each(res, function(i, item) {
          console.log('REPO NAME: ' + item.name);
          tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO tt values (?)", JSON.stringify(item.name));
        });
      }
    });
  }, function(e) {
    console.log('Transaction error: ' + e.message);
  }, function() {
    // Check results:
    db.executeSql('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tt', [], function(res) {
      console.log('Check SELECT result: ' + JSON.stringify(res.rows.item(0)));
    });
  });
```

You can find more details and a step-by-step description how to do this right in the [Populating Cordova SQLite storage with the JQuery API post](http://www.brodybits.com/cordova/sqlite/api/jquery/2015/10/26/populating-cordova-sqlite-storage-with-the-jquery-api.html):

## Background processing

The threading model depends on which version is used:
- For Android, one background thread per db;
- for iOS, background processing using a very limited thread pool (only one thread working at a time);
- ~~for Windows "Universal" (8.1), no background processing (for future consideration).~~

# Sample with PRAGMA feature

This is a pretty strong test: first we create a table and add a single entry, then query the count to check if the item was inserted as expected. Note that a new transaction is created in the middle of the first callback.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    // demonstrate PRAGMA:
    db.executeSql("pragma table_info (test_table);", [], function(res) {
      console.log("PRAGMA res: " + JSON.stringify(res));
    });

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      db.transaction(function(tx) {
        tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
          console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
          console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
        });
      });

    }, function(e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

**NOTE:** PRAGMA statements must be executed in `executeSql()` on the database object (i.e. `db.executeSql()`) and NOT within a transaction.

## Sample with transaction-level nesting

In this case, the same transaction in the first executeSql() callback is being reused to run executeSql() again.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener('deviceready', onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase("Database", "1.0", "Demo", -1);

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
        console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
        console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
      });

    }, function(e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

This case will also works with Safari (WebKit), assuming you replace `window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase` with `window.openDatabase`.

## Close a database object

```js
db.close(successcb, errorcb);
```

It is OK to close the database within a transaction callback but *NOT* within a statement callback. The following example is OK:

```Javascript
db.transaction(function(tx) {
  tx.executeSql("SELECT LENGTH('tenletters') AS stringlength", [], function(tx, res) {
    console.log('got stringlength: ' + res.rows.item(0).stringlength);
  });
}, function(error) {
  // OK to close here:
  console.log('transaction error: ' + error.message);
  db.close();
}, function() {
  // OK to close here:
  console.log('transaction ok');
  db.close(function() {
    console.log('database is closed ok');
  });
});
```

The following example is NOT OK:

```Javascript
// BROKEN:
db.transaction(function(tx) {
  tx.executeSql("SELECT LENGTH('tenletters') AS stringlength", [], function(tx, res) {
    console.log('got stringlength: ' + res.rows.item(0).stringlength);
    // BROKEN - this will trigger the error callback:
    db.close(function() {
      console.log('database is closed ok');
    }, function(error) {
      console.log('ERROR closing database');
    });
  });
});
```

**BUG 1:** It is currently NOT possible to close a database in a `db.executeSql` callback. For example:

```Javascript
// BROKEN DUE TO BUG:
db.executeSql("SELECT LENGTH('tenletters') AS stringlength", [], function (res) {
  var stringlength = res.rows.item(0).stringlength;
  console.log('got stringlength: ' + res.rows.item(0).stringlength);

  // BROKEN - this will trigger the error callback DUE TO BUG:
  db.close(function() {
    console.log('database is closed ok');
  }, function(error) {
    console.log('ERROR closing database');
  });
});
```

**BUG 2:** If multiple database access objects are opened for the same database and one database access object is closed, the database is no longer available for the other database access objects. Possible workarounds:
- It is still possible to open one or more new database access objects on a database that has been closed.
- It *should* be OK not to explicitly close a database handle since database transactions are [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) compliant and the app's memory resources are cleaned up by the system upon termination.

## Delete a database

```js
window.sqlitePlugin.deleteDatabase({name: "my.db", location: 1}, successcb, errorcb);
```

`location` as described above for `openDatabase` (iOS *only*)

FIXED: ~~**NOTE:** not implemented for Windows "Universal" (8.1) version.~~

# Schema versions

The transactional nature of the API makes it relatively straightforward to manage a database schema that may be upgraded over time (adding new columns or new tables, for example). Here is the recommended procedure to follow upon app startup:
- Check your database schema version number (you can use `db.executeSql` since it should be a very simple query)
- If your database needs to be upgraded, do the following *within a single transaction* to be failure-safe:
  - Create your database schema version table (single row single column) if it does not exist (you can check the `sqlite_master` table as described at: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1601151/how-do-i-check-in-sqlite-whether-a-table-exists)
  - Add any missing columns and tables, and apply any other changes necessary

**IMPORTANT:** Since we cannot be certain when the users will actually update their apps, old schema versions will have to be supported for a very long time.

## Use with Ionic/ngCordova/Angular

It is recommended to follow the tutorial at: https://blog.nraboy.com/2014/11/use-sqlite-instead-local-storage-ionic-framework/

Documentation at: http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/sqlite/

# Installing

## Easy install with Cordova CLI tool

    npm install -g cordova # if you don't have cordova
    cordova create MyProjectFolder com.my.project MyProject && cd MyProjectFolder # if you are just starting
    cordova plugin add https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-common

You can find more details at [this writeup](http://iphonedevlog.wordpress.com/2014/04/07/installing-chris-brodys-sqlite-database-with-cordova-cli-android/).

~~**WARNING:** for Windows target platform please read the section above.~~

**IMPORTANT:** sometimes you have to update the version for a platform before you can build, like: `cordova prepare ios`

**NOTE:** If you cannot build for a platform after `cordova prepare`, you may have to remove the platform and add it again, such as:

    cordova platform rm ios
    cordova platform add ios

## Easy install with plugman tool

```shell
plugman install --platform MYPLATFORM --project path.to.my.project.folder --plugin https://github.com/litehelpers/cordova-sqlite-common
```

where MYPLATFORM is `android`, `ios`~~, or `windows`~~.

A posting how to get started developing on Windows host without the Cordova CLI tool (for Android target only) is available [here](http://brodybits.blogspot.com/2015/03/trying-cordova-for-android-on-windows-without-cordova-cli.html).

## Source tree

- `SQLitePlugin.coffee.md`: platform-independent (Literate coffee-script, can be read by recent coffee-script compiler)
- `www`: `SQLitePlugin.js` platform-independent Javascript as generated from `SQLitePlugin.coffee.md` (and checked in!)
- `src`: platform-specific source code:
   - ~~REMOVED from this version branch: `external` - placeholder used to import `sqlite3.[hc]` in this version branch-needed to build Windows "Universal" (8.1) version~~
   - `android` - Java plugin code for Android
   - `ios` - Objective-C plugin code for iOS;
   - ~~`windows` - Javascript proxy code and SQLite3-WinRT project for Windows "Universal" (8.1);~~
- `spec`: test suite using Jasmine (2.2.0), ported from QUnit `test-www` test suite, working on all platforms
- `tests`: very simple Jasmine test suite that is run on Circle CI (Android version) and Travis CI (iOS version)
- `Lawnchair-adapter`: Lawnchair adaptor, based on the version from the Lawnchair repository, with the basic Lawnchair test suite in `test-www` subdirectory

## Manual installation - Android version

These installation instructions are based on the Android example project from Cordova/PhoneGap 2.7.0, using the `lib/android/example` subdirectory from the PhoneGap 2.7 zipball.

 - Install `SQLitePlugin.js` from `www` into `assets/www`
 - Install `SQLitePlugin.java` from `src/android/io/liteglue` into `src/io/liteglue` subdirectory
 - Add the plugin element `<plugin name="SQLitePlugin" value="io.liteglue.SQLitePlugin"/>` to `res/xml/config.xml`

Sample change to `res/xml/config.xml` for Cordova/PhoneGap 2.x:

```diff

     <plugin name="Device" value="org.apache.cordova.Device"/>
```

Before building for the first time, you have to update the project with the desired version of the Android SDK with a command like:

    android update project --path $(pwd) --target android-19

(assuming Android SDK 19, use the correct desired Android SDK number here)

**NOTE:** using this plugin on Cordova pre-3.0 requires the following changes to `SQLitePlugin.java`:

## Manual installation - iOS version

### SQLite library

In the Project "Build Phases" tab, select the _first_ "Link Binary with Libraries" dropdown menu and add the library `libsqlite3.dylib` or `libsqlite3.0.dylib`.

**NOTE:** In the "Build Phases" there can be multiple "Link Binary with Libraries" dropdown menus. Please select the first one otherwise it will not work.

### SQLite Plugin

- Copy `SQLitePlugin.[hm]` from `src/ios` into your project Plugins folder and add them in XCode (I always just have "Create references" as the option selected).
- Copy `SQLitePlugin.js` from `www` into your project `www` folder
- Enable the SQLitePlugin in `config.xml`

Sample change to `config.xml` for Cordova/PhoneGap 2.x:

```diff
--- config.xml.old	2013-05-17 13:18:39.000000000 +0200

## Installation test

### Easy installation test

Use `window.sqlitePlugin.echoTest` as described above (please wait for the `deviceready` event).

### Quick installation test

Assuming your app has a recent template as used by the Cordova create script, add the following code to the `onDeviceReady` function, after `app.receivedEvent('deviceready');`:

```Javascript
  window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({ name: 'hello-world.db' }, function (db) {
    db.executeSql("select length('tenletters') as stringlength", [], function (res) {
      var stringlength = res.rows.item(0).stringlength;
      console.log('got stringlength: ' + stringlength);
      document.getElementById('deviceready').querySelector('.received').innerHTML = 'stringlength: ' + stringlength;
   });
  });
```

### Old installation test

# Support

## Reporting issues

If you have an issue with the plugin please check the following first:
- You are using the latest version of the Plugin Javascript & platform-specific Java or Objective-C source from this repository.
- You have installed the Javascript & platform-specific Java or Objective-C correctly.
- You have included the correct version of the cordova Javascript and SQLitePlugin.js and got the path right.
- You have registered the plugin properly in `config.xml`.

If you still cannot get something to work, please create a fresh, clean Cordova project, add this plugin according to the instructions above, and try a simple test program.

If you continue to see the issue in a new, clean Cordova project:
- Make the simplest test program you can to demonstrate the issue, including the following characteristics:
  - it completely self-contained, i.e. it is using no extra libraries beyond cordova & SQLitePlugin.js;
  - if the issue is with *adding* data to a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database and create the table;
  - if the issue is with *retrieving* data from a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database, create the table, and enter the data you are trying to retrieve.

# Unit tests

Unit testing is done in `spec`.

## running tests from shell

To run the tests from \*nix shell, simply do either:

    ./bin/test.sh ios

or for Android:

    ./bin/test.sh android

To run from a windows powershell (here is a sample for android target):

    .\bin\test.ps1 android

# Adapters

## Lawnchair Adapter

### Common adapter

Please look at the `Lawnchair-adapter` tree that contains a common adapter, which should also work with the Android version, along with a test-www directory.

### Included files

Include the following Javascript files in your HTML:

- `cordova.js` (don't forget!)
- `lawnchair.js` (you provide)
- `SQLitePlugin.js` (in case of Cordova pre-3.0)
- `Lawnchair-sqlitePlugin.js` (must come after `SQLitePlugin.js` in case of Cordova pre-3.0)

### Sample

The `name` option determines the sqlite database filename, *with no extension automatically added*. Optionally, you can change the db filename using the `db` option.

In this example, you would be using/creating a database with filename `kvstore`:

```Javascript
kvstore = new Lawnchair({name: "kvstore"}, function() {
  // do stuff
);
```

Using the `db` option you can specify the filename with the desired extension and be able to create multiple stores in the same database file. (There will be one table per store.)

```Javascript
recipes = new Lawnchair({db: "cookbook", name: "recipes", ...}, myCallback());
ingredients = new Lawnchair({db: "cookbook", name: "ingredients", ...}, myCallback());
```

**KNOWN ISSUE:** the new db options are *not* supported by the Lawnchair adapter. The workaround is to first open the database file using `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`.

## PouchDB

The adapter is now part of [PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/) thanks to [@nolanlawson](https://github.com/nolanlawson), see [PouchDB FAQ](http://pouchdb.com/faq.html).

# Contributing

## Community

- Testimonials of apps that are using this plugin would be especially helpful.
- Reporting issues can help improve the quality of this plugin.

## Code

**WARNING:** Please do NOT propose changes from your default branch. In general, contributions are rebased using `git rebase` or `git cherry-pick` and not merged.

- Patches with bug fixes are helpful, especially when submitted with test code.
- Other enhancements welcome for consideration, when submitted with test code and are working for all supported platforms. Increase of complexity should be avoided.
- All contributions may be reused by [@brodybits (Chris Brody)](https://github.com/brodybits) under another license in the future. Efforts will be taken to give credit for major contributions but it will not be guaranteed.
- Project restructuring, i.e. moving files and/or directories around, should be avoided if possible.
- If you see a need for restructuring, it is better to first discuss it in new issue where alternatives can be discussed before reaching a conclusion. If you want to propose a change to the project structure:
  - Remember to make (and use) a special branch within your fork from which you can send the proposed restructuring;
  - Always use `git mv` to move files & directories;
  - Never mix a move/rename operation with any other changes in the same commit.
